## What is GoShortrr?
The goal of this project is to provide a clean web dashboard as well as a fast and open REST API to shorten URLs (even headless, i.e. without the web dashboard).
The RESTful API is supposed to give you an interface that is just as powerful as the web dashboard, so all the features of the web dashboard should have an open and documented API implementation. That enables you to use GoShortrr in other projects (for instance a blog or chat bot) to automatically create, delete manage and analyze shortlinks.

## Features
### Web Dashboard
GoShortrr ships with a nice and clean web dashboard that aims to give you a front-end implementation of all REST API features. It's build using React, so it's a SPA (single page application).

Screenshots coming soon!

### REST API
As mentioned above, GoShortrr has a fast and open REST API that aims to provide an implementation of all of GoShortrr's features. The web dashboard itself utilizes this API, there is no such thing as an internal API.

API docs coming soon!
